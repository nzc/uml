  			   <p class = "team-introduction-paragraph">Resistance of tropical pathogens to drug resistance and vector-borne resistance to various insecticides is another major factor in the control of tropical diseases such as malaria. In this research field, the laboratory will mainly apply molecular biology, genomics, molecular immunology methods and means to study molecular mechanisms of tropical disease pathogens and vector-based drug resistance mechanism, and then find the treatment and intervention of tropical pathogens And insect-borne vector resistance of the new method.<p>
  			   <p class = "team-introduction-paragraph">The current researchers generally believe that the vaccine is the most safe, cheap and effective means of prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. But today, in the field of tropical disease vaccine, especially malaria vaccine research, although the international community has invested a lot of manpower, financial resources and material resources, scientists have done a lot of research work, has not yet developed and produced any clear clinical control effect Of the vaccine. Therefore, there are many research gaps in the development of tropical disease vaccine. Key Laboratory of Tropical Pathogen Biology will make full use of molecular biology, immunology, cell biology and contemporary advanced biotechnology methods and means, in addition to looking for effective induction of the host immune system of tropical disease pathogens and humoral cellular immune response vector and Zuo , To solve the traditional vaccine immunization titer is too low, the duration is not long traditional vaccine strategy deficiencies, but also the use of new construction and preparation of vaccine technology and strategies focus on the development of malaria, dengue fever, Rickettsia and other tropical diseases Prevention and treatment of vaccine.<p>
  			   <p class = "team-introduction-paragraph">Polypeptides are biologically active substances involved in various cellular functions in organisms. Almost all cells are regulated by peptides, which are involved in various fields such as hormone secretion, nerve, cell growth and reproduction. The study of the effects of peptides secreted by the body on the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease will not only contribute to the understanding of human physiological and pathophysiological processes, but also provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but also help to find some New proteins associated with disease. The Key Laboratory of Tropical Diseases will focus on molecular and cellular biology to search for active peptides from marine organisms and tropical pathogens. It will seek to discover several polypeptides with tropical disease activity, and explore the role of these peptides in Tropical disease incidence and prognosis of the mechanism of action for the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases to find new methods and strategies.<p>
  			   <p class = "team-introduction-paragraph">Tropical disease is mainly caused by biological disease-causing disease, is the tropical region of the frequently-occurring disease and endemic disease. The epidemic of infectious SARS (SARS), which occurred in Guangdong in 2003 and spread to the whole country and the world at large, and the global epidemic of avian influenza in the world in early 2004 caused great disaster to the people of our country and the world. The outbreak of these diseases to the vast Scientific research workers sounded the alarm: must attach great importance to prevention and treatment of infectious diseases research. Although Hainan in these two epidemic spared, but must not be taken lightly. It is important to explore the diagnostic techniques of sensitive, specific, rapid, accurate and quantitative infectious diseases for the effective control of outbreaks of infectious diseases. We will be in the pathogen molecular medical research on the basis of the molecular biology of viral infection diagnosis, cell model, antiviral therapy and evaluation of efficacy of the study; known pathogens such as malaria parasite, hepatitis B virus, tsutsugamushi disease Rick Rapid, sensitive and specific immunoassay for the diagnosis and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infections, such as nematodes, cysticercus cellulosae, cysticercus cellulosae, schistosomiasis, liver flukes, Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium, HIV and coronavirus. Genetic testing of new technologies, the establishment of technical standards, research and development of commercial testing kit, the establishment of common methods of diagnosis and prevention of tropical diseases, research and development of gene vaccines.<p>
  			   <p class = "team-introduction-paragraph">To carry out the external testing of tropical pathogens, and provide professional treatment recommendations. The epidemiological investigation of the above-mentioned various human parasites and other infectious diseases among the population in the province will fill in the gaps in relevant information in the province and provide accurate epidemiological data for relevant organizations. At the same time to carry out prevention and control of related research. AIDS and tuberculosis prevention and control measures and strategies, focusing on AIDS and tuberculosis diagnosis and screening, prevention and education and intervention methods such as applied research.<p>
